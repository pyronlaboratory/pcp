class ParallelWalk():
    """This class implements a parallel directory walking algorithm described 
    by LaFon, Misra and Bringhurst
    http://conferences.computer.org/sc/2012/papers/1000a015.pdf

    The class expects an MPI communicator as an argument.
   
    from lib.parallelwalk import ParallelWalk
    from mpi4py import MPI
    comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
    walker = ParallelWalk(comm)

    To start the walker, call the execute() method. MPI rank 0 should pass 
    in a seed directory. Currently seeds to MPI ranks other than rank 0 will 
    be ignored.
    
    if rank == 0:
       seed = "/my/dir"
    else:
       seed = None
    results = walker.execute(seed)

    As it stands, the walker will walk the directory tree and then exit. It will
    return no data and perform no actions on file and directories it encounters.

    The execute method should only be executed once; there is alot of undefined state
    left in the walker once it has finished crawling.

    In order to customize its behaviour you should subclass ParallelWalk() and extend
    the ProcessDir() and ProcessFile() methods. These methods are called on every
    directory and file the walker encounters.

    The amount of work the ProcessDir() and ProcessFile() methods carry out should be
    as small as possible to ensure efficient work balancing between the workers.
    Tasks stuck in these functions will not be able to answer work requests from other
    nodes.

    If you want to return summary data from the walker, use the results
    attribute. You can set results to a particular datatype by setting the results
    parameter when you instantiate the class. By default results is None.

    results are gathered and returned as a list by the rank 0
    walker. The list contains the results from each MPI rank. If you wish to change
    this behaviour you can extend the gatherResults() method.

    The following example modified the walker to print out the name of each
    file it encounters and count the total number of files.

    class printfiles(ParallelWalk):
        def ProcessFile(self, filename)
            print filename
            self.results += 1
         
    walker  = printfile(comm, results=0)
    listofresults = walker.Execute()
